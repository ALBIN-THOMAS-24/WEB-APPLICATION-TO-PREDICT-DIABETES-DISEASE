# WEB-APPLICATION-TO-PREDICT-DIABETES-DISEASE [ML-ALGORITHM AND FLASK]



****PROJECT: DIABETIC-PREDICTION-WEB-APP*****

**DATA ANALYSIS**:
In  this  project,  3  ML algorithms  are  used   i.e  SVM, LOGISTIC  and  KNN  is  used  and  the  accuracy  of  the  model  is  calculated  and  
then  the  3 algorithms are  stacked together and  find out  accuracy  of  the  model .  After  the  analysis, I  have found out  that  
Logistic  Regression  have  bettter  accuracy[83%]  and  this  trained  model  is  used  in  my  web-app. 


These  trained  model [logistic-regression] is  deployed  in  my  web  app  and  whenever  user  enter the  data , these data  is  sent  to  the  model  using  FLASK  SERVER. 
Flask is  a  web  framework  written  in  Python.  The  data  entered  in  the  webpage  is  given  to  the  trained  model  in  the  web-page  and  the model  predicts 
either 0  or  1  based  on  the  data  entered  by  the  user.

RESULT
*************************
0  means : NON-DIABETIC
1  means : DIABETIC


THE  RESULT  IS  DISPLAYED   IN  THE  WEB-PAGE
